# Vim Venders!

A Vim config inspired by the work of [Wim Wenders][wim].

Checkout to `~/.vim` or (`~/.config/nvim`) and get to work.

There are also a few tools you can install for a better experience:

MacOS:

    brew install ripgrep ctags python nodejs npm

or Arch Linux:

    sudo pacman -S ripgrep ctags python nodejs npm

And then:

    # Install Elm and JavaScript tools
    npm -g install \
        elm elm-test elm-oracle elm-format \
        flow-bin eslint babel-eslint eslint-plugin-react prettier

    # Install Python tools
    pip install flake8 mypy yapf

If youâ€™re working with Haskell you may also want to install the
[Haskll IDE Engine][hie].
