# Vim Venders!

A Vim config inspired by the work of Wim Wenders.

## Quick Setup

There’s a setup script included that will create a bunch of directories in ~/.vim as well as symlink ~/.vimrc and ~/.gvimrc to ~/.vim/vimrc and ~/.vim/gvimrc, respectively. Checkout and setup like so:

    git clone https://github.com/roshambo/vim-venders.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    ./setup
