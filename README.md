# Vim Venders!

A Vim config inspired by the work of [Wim Wenders][wim].


## Quick Setup

Thereâ€™s a setup script included that will create a bunch of directories in
`~/.vim`, symlink `~/.vimrc` to `~/.vim/vimrc` and install a bunch of plugins.

Make sure you have [Make], [Node.js][node] and [NPM][npm] installed (for [Tern] and
[YouCompleteMe][ycm]) and then run the following:

    git clone https://github.com/meowgorithm/vim-venders.git ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    make

On MacOS, [Make][make] is included with [Xcode][xcode]. If you're on Linux, you
probably already have it installed, and if you don't, you probably know
how to install it.
